# advised to merely create a new file using only the options you actually need.

# Note: Variables in lowercase are only used by simple-cdd.

# Profile Selection
#
# The following four files get included on the CD if present:
# $profile.preseed  
#   Debconf selections.
# $profile.packages  
#   Packages to be installed with the profile. Dependencies also will 
#   be installed.
# $profile.downloads  
#   Additional packages to be included on the CD with this profile, but 
#   not installed by default.
# $profile.postinst  
#   Post-install script that is run after installing packages.
#
# During the install after base system setup, it will give you the 
# options to determine which profiles you want to install.
